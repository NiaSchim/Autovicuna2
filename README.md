# Autovicuna2
the second in my autovicuna series. I've got glitchy output from an offline model. that's good enough for me for now. time to take a break for awhile....

the first one was coded from scratch, the second one is a blatant re-tooling of autogpt, and I'm not very skilled, so I've gotten about as far as I'm going to get for now sadly...

it produces some output but not in the correct JSON format, so it needs some delicate tweaking, sadly my approach is more like a sledge hammer, so yeah...
